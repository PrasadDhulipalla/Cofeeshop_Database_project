Here's a professional and complete structure for your README.md file to showcase your Coffee Shop PostgreSQL Data Project on GitHub. This format highlights your skills, datasets, database design, SQL analytics, and visualizations clearly and attractively.

‚òï Coffee Shop Data Warehouse & Analytics Project
A full-stack data engineering and analytics project using a fictional coffee shop dataset. Designed using PostgreSQL with Star and Snowflake schemas, applied normalization techniques, performed advanced SQL analytics, and visualized insights with Power BI.

üìå Project Objectives
Design a clean, normalized relational database in PostgreSQL.

Implement both Star and Snowflake schema structures.

Load and transform real-world datasets (from Kaggle).

Perform SQL-based analytics for business insights.

Build interactive dashboards in Power BI.

üóÇÔ∏è Datasets Used
Coffee Shop Sales Data (Kaggle)

Staff, Shifts, Orders, Items, Inventory, Recipes, Ingredients

All synthetic datasets were cleaned and modeled before loading into PostgreSQL.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Database: PostgreSQL (pgAdmin 4)

Languages: SQL, Python (optional for ETL scripts)

Modeling: ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), Normalization (3NF)

Schema Design: Star and Snowflake
